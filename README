Creates a FIFO queue of <numBufEntries> max size.
If the queue is full, any process attempting to read from it will be blocked.
If the queue is empty, any process attempting to write to it will be blocked.

usage:
type "make" to use the provided Makefile to compile mypipe.c into mypipe.ko
type "insmod mypipe.ko <numBufEntries = N>" to insert the module into the kernel,
     creating a queue of at most N entries.  Leaving off the numBufEntries
     argument sets the queue to its default size of ten entries.
